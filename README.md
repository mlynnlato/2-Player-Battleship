# 2-Player-Battleship

1.  The user will determine which level they would like to play 
easy(e), medium(m) or hard(h). These will determine the size of 
the board.  
2.  Using a random number generator, a board will be selected that 
determines where the ships are located. These will be pre-made 
boards that indicate the ships as 1’s and blank spaces as 0’s. 
This board is not displayed to the user. There need to need to be 
different boards based on the level of difficulty. There should 
be at least three ships on the board.  
3.  The user will make a choice on the grid (i.e. B7) they will need 
to compare that index to the pre made grid (again 1s and 0s) and 
then proceed to AND (&) the location indicated by the user to the 
static grid... i.e. if B7 is a hit then 1 and 1 still makes a 1 
otherwise it is a miss... 
4.  The board that the player sees will be updated after each play 
indicating where ships have been hit.
